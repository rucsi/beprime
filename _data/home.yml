          What is your dream location and what would you like to visit once at all cost?
          And where did you go to holidays last year?

      If the answers to these two questions aren't the same, the reason must be the money - what else?
      Are you familiar with the feeling, when you search the travel sites for weeks for a reasonable last minute deal, and every evening you sit on your packed suitcase and fret about missing one, or there's only a one bed room with "fire-wall view" left?
    - |
      Or you book the available discounted trip depending on your days off without considering what you would want?
      Have you ever picked self catering because of the lower price, so you still had to do the shopping, cooking, washing up every day, just like at home? Don't you deserve real relaxation without compromises?
    - You should know, there is a difference between choosing a cheap trip, or a good trip cheap... and it could be HUGE. We know all the nightmares of the discounted holidays starting from their filthy room without climate control, through to the misleading hotel descriptions and information up to the low standard of cuisine.
  - note: These would be the best days of our lives?

    - The prices of the PRIMEDAYS booking system are 20-60% cheaper on average than the offers of other portals or travel agencies.
    - Why pay more when you can spend the extra money on yourself and your loved ones? Stay an extra 2 days, pay for a additional excursions, buy your other half some souvenirs, take your parents with you, or simply keep the difference and use it for a wellness weekend or a breakaway.

      When you start searching in the PRIMEDAYS booking system your first though might be this:
      - This cannot be true. There must be a lot of additional costs which will only reveal themselves later.
      But there isn't! Our prices - unlike most of the other systems - contain all expenses and fees. No surprises, just reliability.

      Your second thought could be this:
      - Oh, all the money I have paid so far unnecessarily...
      Unfortunately we cannot change that, but the good news is, you don't need to anymore!
    - You will be able cast around over one billion offers every day of the year as part of the PRIMEDAYS system, in addition we will be continuously handpicking the most outstanding trips, if you would like to decide spontaneously.

  - p: How would a travel agency's window or prospectus know where you would like to travel the most? Your possible destinations are often limited by the offers and the charter flights so you are more likely to meet your fellow countrymen during your trip than staying at home. Nevertheless Croatia, Greece, Spain, Tunisia are beautiful, but maybe you could explore new places and get to know new cultures year by year. You could see the world in different perspectives and show them to your children if you knew it could be possible and affordable.
  - note: The limits erase in the PRIMEDAYS booking system.
