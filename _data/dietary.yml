      - Preserving a pretty, feminine shape is practically a constant challenge for ladies. Although many plus sized ladies live happily and contentedly, enjoys her other half's admiration for rounded forms, unfortunately this is rarely the case. Many people struggle a lifetime to catch up with a desired shape, which is not certain for the compliance of the opposite sex, but rather for the slenderly-built, graceful, eternally smiling, thin-ideal body image portrayed in the media. Despite knowing that this is not the key of true happiness, it would be irresponsible to bury our heads in the sand and ignore plenty of those fates, whose bitter root of origin is exactly being overweight.
      - Many struggle with excess weight after the joy of childbirth, searching for their former shape, but could just not look back at the mirror. The lack of the old shape is overshadowed by the miracle of motherhood for a while, but with time self-confidence could reduce. They find themselves less of a woman. Convince themselves that as a mother this does not matter. They try to dismiss the disturbing thoughts, explain with genetics, the lack of time, stress... This kind of resignation traps them to gain further weight.
      - If only they weren't snapped back to reality over and over again by a counter-example! If only they wouldn’t encounter a pretty, slim, full of life mother every day! They wish they wouldn’t remember that petite secretary at their husband's office...
      - We keep on reading stories about people who changed their life-styles successfully, and are now proudly smiling to the world as well as the mirror.

      - Let's start with a sad, unfortunate fact. Men’s lives are shorter. How is it that the stronger sex is the weaker? Numerous reasons could exist, but there is one physiological point, in which the crown of creation is definitely different from an ordinary woman... and this is nothing else but the abdominal obesity.
      - Why is this dangerous? While most of the fat is deposited around the hips in majority of women, men grow a belly spectacularly. This means that the extra pounds for the ladies represents mostly an aesthetic problem. On the other hand, the adipose tissues appearing on the gentlemen's waist and abdomen are deposited directly around their internal organs, greatly increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases, which is among the leading causes of death, and the chance for diabetes.
      - Thus, while the reason of women's diet is primarily a pretty appearance, the men's lives could often depend on noticing the slinking pounds in time. And we have yet to talk about every alpha-male's nightmare,  which could become reality because of the more and more dormant libido due to the blunted, sluggish body.
      - Let's be clear, as slyly as the extra weight comes, it is harder to make it go away. If you do not want the world changing you and all the beauty of your handsome manhood with a fat belly and its consequences, then you need to change the world.

    text:
      - The number of obese children doubled in the last 15 years in the United Stated, over 25 million overweight children live in the European Union and their numbers are increasing rapidly, 500 thousand a year. Yet strangely this tendency remains in some ways taboo, which is clearly established by the adults.
      - Although the youngster himself could be responsible for the condition in the rarest cases, he is the one who suffers all of its consequences. As charming as the childish sincerity is, as painful as it could be to hear an "innocent" mockery on the playground. Not to mention the serious health consequences, which are largely attributable to the account of childhood obesity, such as anxiety, asthma or type 2 diabetes.
      - Since the most susceptible stage of our lives is our childhood, our children copy our behavioural norms, which should not disregard the love of a healthy diet and lifestyle.
      - The environment  constructed by the consumer society could be held responsible, largely, for one in four children are overweight in the US. Think of the high sugar content in - what can hardly be called food - the colourful, inviting packaging of snacks and in-store placement. It's all about, whether it's chocolate, gum, ice cream or chips, to consume, buy, spend, become addicted - regardless of how this will affect the growing life.
      - A general ambition of PRIMESHAPE is to emphasise the importance of prevention and provide parents with the basics of a healthy lifestyle with its philosophy and the help of its professionals. Our goal is to be able to stop the tragic trend of the number of obese youngsters, keep growing by leaps and bounds every year, with incalculable consequences for health.
